# FizzBuzz-Practice
Practicing my coding basics using the popular fizzbuzz coding practice

This is a set of programs of me practicing making the popular FizzBuzz programs.
I am using this program while very simple to keep my basic skills and to learn the basics of multiple languages

FizzBuzz program;
The rules:
- The program counts from 1 to 100
- Any number divisible by 3 is replaced with Fizz
- Any number divisible by 5 is replaces with Buzz
- Any number divisible by 3 and 5 is replaced with FizzBuzz

This is a simple practice but helps learn the basics of languages.
